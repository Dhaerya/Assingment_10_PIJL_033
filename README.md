This project demonstrates the usage of Java threads across multiple classes and files.

## Files:

- `Main.java` – Creates and runs two threads: one for numbers and one for alphabets.
- `PrintNumbers.java` – Prints numbers 1 to 5 with a delay.
- `PrintAlphabets.java` – Prints alphabets A to E with a delay.
- `Main.class` – Compiled version of Main.java

## How It Works

- Both threads are started in parallel.
- Thread sleeps are used to simulate processing time.
- `join()` ensures main thread waits for child threads to finish.

Each file is committed separately along with method-level commits.
